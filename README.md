# Market-simulator
A market simulator that pulls real price information that I can use to test and automate my trading strategies without relying on paid charting software like tradingview.

Later adding features that will connect to the exchange bitfinex so I am not limited to using their web interface to make orders and perform trades on my behalf.

### Why not use the python lib already built by bitfinex?
Because I want to strengthen my programming skills and end up with a tool I can continue to use to my advantage when I'm done.
